# ESP32 Smart Lock System 

An IoT-enabled smart lock system built using an ESP32 microcontroller and programmed in C++ via the Arduino framework.  
This project showcases embedded systems programming, Wi-Fi-based authentication, and GPIO-based control of a locking mechanism.

## Features

- Unlocks door via Wi-Fi-triggered conditions
- Uses GPIO pins to control a physical lock (relay or servo)
- Wi-Fi connection and state change logic via serial input or HTTP (depending on extension)
- Status feedback over Serial Monitor
- Low-power and compact for real-world embedded use

## Technologies Used

- **ESP32** microcontroller
- **Arduino IDE** (C/C++)
- **Wi-Fi module** (built-in ESP32)
- GPIO pin control
- (Optional: Relay module, servo motor, magnetic lock, etc.)
